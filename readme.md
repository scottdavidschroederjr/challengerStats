Project has basic functionality and technically would be ready to launch but the display of stats on the site needs to be much better than it current is. Also there's a lot of functionality that I'd want to add on top of this. 

Latest major updates
- added database support to avoid 

TODOs
- create function that can add additional matches to the data
- clean up visually on display site
- make this readme into a better explantion of the project itself
- clean up code to inhance readability
