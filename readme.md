Last Readme Update: 7/13/23

Project has basic functionality and technically would be ready to launch but the display of stats on the site needs to be much better than it current is. Also there's a lot of functionality that I'd want to add on top of this. 

Latest major updates
- added database support to avoid 

TODOs
- create function that can add additional matches to the data
- clean up visually on display site
- make this readme into a better explantion of the project itself
- clean up code to inhance readability 
- add static API key as a secret in the project so I don't have to keep adding and remove the daily one that changes
- want to get full data collection from matches because 1. might as well 2. if I'm going to maintain a database of every TFT match, I can use this for multiple projects / use it for tools to make me better at the game, so I want to add units, traits and emblems to match 
- add better error messages for database adds
