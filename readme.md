Last Readme Update: 7/16/23

Forked this from the duoStats project as I think this is a more interesting road to go down with this project and creating a new repo will allow me to be a bit more distructive with my changes which will keep the new code cleaner. The tentative plan is to have a barebones version of the site up and running for the patch that comes out on 7/19/23 (just basic data on an Amazon hosted site but that may end up being a little too ambious.

Tenative timeline
(7/16/23) - switch to new repo, clean up old DuoStats files and collect test data to use to prep for site
(7/17/23) - get SQL joins/queries functioning properly
(7/18/23) - setup Amazon site and push project to there
(7/19/23) - launch site and troubleshoot bugs
